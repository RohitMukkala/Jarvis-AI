# Jarvis-AI
Jarvis AI is a voice-activated personal assistant developed using Python, integrating speech recognition, OpenAI's GPT-3 API, and automation features. The project aims to replicate a basic version of the iconic Jarvis assistant from the Iron Man series, allowing users to interact with their computer through natural language voice commands.
